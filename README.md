# Chat-with-Strangers

🚀 Just Built: Chat with Strangers — Real-time Group Chat App 🎯
- Ever just crave a random conversation with someone you’ve never met?
- Well… now you can! 💬
- Over the past few days, I built a real-time group chat app where strangers get instantly dropped into small, private rooms — think speed dating, but for conversations (and zero awkward eye contact). 😄

✨ What It Can Do:
 - 💨 Lightning-fast messaging with Socket.IO + Node.js
 - 🏠 Auto-room assignment (max 3 people) — keeping it cozy & personal
 - 📊 Live user count so you’re never talking into the void
 - ↔ My messages on the right, yours on the left (with your name in lights ✨)
 - 📜 Scrollable chat window for those epic story times
 - 📱 Fully responsive — works on desktop, mobile, or even your fridge browser (probably)
  👋 Instant join/leave alerts so you know when to say “Hi” or “Bye”
 - 🔐 CORS magic for both local testing & deployed glory
 - 📝 Username prompt before joining — or embrace the mystery as Anonymous #123

## Kept the UI minimal — the spotlight’s on backend logic, scalability, and buttery-smooth real-time performance. 🛠️
